To be honest, I just wanted a place where I can ***digitize*** my rough notes. 

A very subtle disclaimer that these are not ***professional articles*** on concepts I write or speak about.

I might probably make more updates in the future to the theme and the style of this website but right now I am good. 

Some deets about me, 
  1. Working as a **Data Scientist** at [Datacy Inc.][datacy]
  2. Big time computer nerd ( ***still learning*** )
  3. I dance ðŸ•º wanna shake a leg with me? find me here -> [Instagram][insta]


<!-- Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %} -->

I am gonna follow a **pattern** in all of my coming posts which is simply gonna be something like this,

```
  Reference Links - Link1, Link2, Link3

  Content

  Images 
```

I am gonna attach the links that I referred to first so that you guys would go through the links attached and then read my perspective on them. Not a great thought but ***whatever*** ðŸ¥±


I guess some of you **nerds** must have figured it out but the "tech" I used to set up my roughbook quickly were **Github Pages** and **Jekyll**, they are awesome!
